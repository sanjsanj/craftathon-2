###Brief

Makers Academy is going to space!

- Evgeny and Ruben have gotten ballsier and have decided to rent a spaceship to take 8 passengers on a 12-week round trip to the moon.

Your Mission: Launch a website allowing people to book tickets.

###Job stories for the user

```
When I am planning my next holiday
I want to become really excited about flying around the moon
So that I can be part of a select few

When I see the price
I want to feel like that's a worthwhile investment
So that I know the cost is justified

When I decide to book my ticket(s)
I want to be able to reserve my seat(s)
So that I can know that I am going far, far away
```

###Job stories for the admin

```
When I figure out how much to charge
I want to be able to set the price per ticket
So that users know how much it costs

When I log in to my dashboard
I want to see who has reserved seats on Makers Galactic I
So that I can know if my MVP worked

When I have a full spaceship
I want the site to show the flight as full
So that it doesn't get overbooked

When I fill my first flight
I want to take reservations for my next flight
So that I can make this business a success
```

We would like to see well crafted, test-driven code and a well thought out, slick UX/UI.
